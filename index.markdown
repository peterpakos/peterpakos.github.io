# Hi, I’m Peter — Site Reliability Engineering Lead

I’m based in Barnsley, United Kingdom, and hold a Bachelor of Computer Engineering from the West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin, Poland.

As an SRE Lead, I focus on building and scaling reliable, observable, and secure cloud-native platforms. My work bridges engineering and leadership — ensuring systems run smoothly at scale while helping teams grow and deliver with confidence.

Key areas of expertise include platform reliability, incident response, observability, automation with Infrastructure as Code, and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.

You can find examples of my projects and tools on [GitHub](https://github.com/peterpakos).

## Outside of Work

Beyond technology, I value time with my family and enjoy experimenting in my home lab, where I explore emerging tools and approaches to keep my skills sharp.
